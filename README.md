# Fantasy-Football-2018-Draft-Analysis
Exploring the FF league's 2018 Draft. What went wrong, how did we do, and where can I find a competitive advantage for the next year.

Drafted Players sheets contain the lists of all drafted players, auction style, in our Fantasy Football League. Our drafts are done offline, and thus there is no ESPN or automate-able data to retrieve all the draft information beyond a manual compilation. The .csv contains the mass list of all the players. The Excel workbook contains a sheet of all the players and separate sheets for each year as well.

10 Guys One Cup Draft Trends.ipynb is the R Jupyter Notebook that contains the Data Frames, graphics, and analysis. Trends, prices, future moves, etc. ff draft trends.R is the corresponding raw script file without the Jupyter Format. These two files are stored within the "2018 Draft Trends" folder.
